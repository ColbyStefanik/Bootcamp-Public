//Code snippets from the Coding Dojo, assignment is to predict the outcome of each snippet.

const cars = ['Tesla', 'Mercedes', 'Honda']
const [ randomCar ] = cars
const [ ,otherRandomCar ] = cars
//Predict the output
console.log(randomCar)
console.log(otherRandomCar)

//randomCar would be Tesla, while otherRandomCar would be Mercedes

const employee = {
    name: 'Elon',
    age: 47,
    company: 'Tesla'
}
const { name: otherName } = employee;
//Predict the output
console.log(name);
console.log(otherName);

//name would provide a null value, while otherName would be Elon

const person = {
    name: 'Phil Smith',
    age: 47,
    height: '6 feet'
}
const password = '12345';
const { password: hashedPassword } = person;  
//Predict the output
console.log(password);
console.log(hashedPassword);

//password would give '12345' while hashedPassword would be a null value

const numbers = [8, 2, 3, 5, 6, 1, 67, 12, 2];
const [,first] = numbers;
const [,,,second] = numbers;
const [,,,,,,,,third] = numbers;
//Predict the output
console.log(first == second);
console.log(first == third);

//first == second would be '2 == 5' while first == third would be '2 == 2'

const lastTest = {
    key: 'value',
    secondKey: [1, 5, 1, 8, 3, 3]
}
const { key } = lastTest;
const { secondKey } = lastTest;
const [ ,willThisWork] = secondKey;
//Predict the output
console.log(key);
console.log(secondKey);
console.log(secondKey[0]);
console.log(willThisWork);

//key would give 'value' while secondKey would give '1, 5, 1, 8, 3, 3' while secondKey[0] would give '1' while willThisWork would give '5'
